# Iterative methods for solvling linear systems of equations via python
In the repo there are a number of iterative methods for solvling linear systems of equations.
Implemented Methods: 
* __Conjugate Gradient__,  
* __Gaussâ€“Seidel__,
* __Jacobi__, 
* __Modified Richardson Iteration__,
* __Successive Over Relaxation__.  

These algorithms have been implemented via __python__ and with help of __numpy__.
